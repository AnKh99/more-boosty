![logo](source/icon.png)

> Chrome / Chromium extension to provide more functions and features for a crowdfunding platform Boosty.

## Features
- Widescreen layout
- Max video quailty (for VK video player)
- Picture-in-picture (for VK video player)
- Theater mode (for Boosty streams)

## Installation
-  [Chrome/Chromium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/more-boosty/kpcbalinpdhnlgonfoflhflnfgcbffbl) 

### Firefox support when?
Unfortunately, Firefox does not support some important stuff (namely, PiP API and background service workers), so I will have to find a way to build the extension for Firefox with appropriate workarounds. And it **must** be auto-magical.
